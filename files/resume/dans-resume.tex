Welcome to the .tex side fellow developer!!!

This is the uncompiled-latex version of my resume which is different then my pdf resume in many ways. I have coded this tex file to be as modular as it can be, meaning that instead of sending tailored resumes to different companies, I have made everything that I want to show off available on this file, and whenever I want to apply to a certain job, I leave the projects that I want, comment out the rest and compile!

So you should be able to see a summary of almost all of my projects on this file. I am also very candid about many different points and have added comments here and there to further clarify many things.

if you want to compile on your own:
please use "xelatex", sometimes pdflatex or other compilers' outputs end up not looking the way the resume was intended to be.

% If you have seen my transcript, you might have doubts about my ability to perform tasks. I am not good at taking tests and have made it all the way through to fourth year, simply because my understanding of the material and perforamnce on assignments is above average. Think about it from this perspective, how is it that I have low marks on second year courses whereas I have gotten better marks at relatively harder courses in third and fourth year? This is due to different courses having different exam and term test weights. My work perforamnce and ethic can be approved by my teammates and professors that I have worked with.
Sessional GPA: 3.5

  kernel modules and to hijack syscall functions to my own custom functions.
  \item Implemented four different page replacement algorithms: FIFO , Clock
   exact LRU, and OPT
