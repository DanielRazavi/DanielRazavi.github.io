    <p class="disable_text_highlighting">EEYYYY, we have finally reached Runtime Analaysis. Trust me when I say that this is going to come in handy in literally (almost) every single project that you'll work on in the future. It's so important that I also did your readings before making the slides, so that I don't miss anything when I want to teach this stuff. Make sure you learn this very very well. READING WEEK, HERE WE COME!!!</p>

    <p class="disable_text_highlighting">So as promised, the Slides are up before the end of the day. A lot of students were wondering about when the midterms are going to be marked and given back (obviously we're just kidding on piazza lol) and the truth is that we don't have a definit answer either, the plan is to do it as soon as possible.
    In the meantime, I want to wish you guys a good luck on all of your midterms and
    please remember, all nighters are never a good decision :).</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:5vw" class="hint disable_text_highlighting">week 7</h1>

    <p class="disable_text_highlighting">I like to call this week "review week" since after all the midterms and preperations you went through, it is now time to go over the new stuff you might have missed (not neccessarily this course). Maybe it wasn't covered by the midterm or maybe you decided to give yourself a break. Whatever the case, right now is the prefect time to prepare for the next wave, it is never too soon.</p>

    <p class="disable_text_highlighting">And that was the second test of this course and after this is just problems sets and the exam. Students were having concerns with the midterm when I talked with them last night, and a lot of people were also displeased with their experiences regarding this course in the survey that we took last week. I am here to tell you that your comments will not be unheard and I will make sure that all TAs and professors hear about them. </p>

    <p class="disable_text_highlighting">Ps. sorry if the mathematical symbols are not done as well as my other slides, I didn't have much time to make the math on latex. Pss. hence why we also don't have recommended youtube videos, but since it is "take two" of program correctness, it shouldnt be an issue.</p>

    <p class="disable_text_highlighting"> In this week we talked about Languages and Regular Expressions and some examples that we went over together. On the second half of the class we went through the solutions to the midterm and what the outline for the marking was for us TAs.  </p>

    <p class="disable_text_highlighting">Recommendation: For Regular Expressions please take a look at notes.pdf, pages 68 to 72, regex in this course is not similar to the one you're probably studying in CSC207 or anything presented online. :)</p>
