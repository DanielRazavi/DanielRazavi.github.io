In last weekâ€™s Youtube Recommendations, I made sure I put one complete induction video so whoever watched it can benefit from that, this week. I apologize for the lateness and the mess that was today's tutorial AAANNNNDDD the fact that these videos were late haha, hopefully won't happen anymore. :)</p>

            <p>Sorry for being late again, I finally got a new computer so hopefully things should get better. Anyways, EEYYYY, we have finally reached Runtime Analaysis. Trust me when I say that this is going to come in handy in literally (almost) every single project that you'll work on in the future. It's so important that I also did your readings before making the slides, so that I don't miss anything when I want to teach this stuff. Make sure you learn this very very well. (PS. No video for q4 since apperently you guys havent learned the material yet, so I'll post it next week)</p>

            <p>Okay so I'm gonna try something new, I'm gonna lowkey upload this rn (friday 11:30 pm) and then post the videos later, so that even if they're late, you can still have the slides and get familiar with the material. Let's see if this method works out and hopefully everything's gonna be good. Aside from that, I have also included last weeks Question 4 in this weeks set of videos, so if you're reading this in December trying to study before the exam, ITS HERE FAMMMM!!! ITS NOT IN WEEK 3! And yeah that is all. :)</p>

            <p>Hey guys! I hope y'all had a lovely reading week and took advantage of the week by either getting ahead in the course, getting caught up or simply taking the time to refresh and get away from it all! I took the time for myself to finally FINAALLYYY record all the remaining tutorials! I just need to put em together and no more late videos!!! yaaayyy! This week's tutorial we're going to work out a structural induction question in class and I'm gonna try to answer some questions regarding the midterm. Aside from that I'm gonna take some time to talk about Problem Set 1 and what happened. Aside from those that is all for now, till next week's post.</p>

            <p> Hi guys! Welcome to post test tutorial week! I hope you did well in the test and found it not so bad. In my opinion you should take a quick break from this class and then (if you haven't already) to really catch up if you are behind, since you're not gonna have any assignments or tests for some time. I hope you guys are doing well becuase I remember being a second year student in first semester, having STA256, MAT232, MAT223, CSC207, and more and more and more crazy subject in one semester. You got this! Don't give up! You can do it!  </p>

            <p> Hi guys! Another month and another term test. I hope everyone had a good time with this one, will look forward to the reddit posts and discord discussions afterwards to hear everyone's feedback. Till then here's what we're going to be working on Monday. It's another one of those lessons that in my opinin, will be what you remember it for and how important it is. Now it is different compared to the CSC207 version, so bare that in mind, but the idea is very similar. </p>
