In last weekâ€™s Youtube Recommendations, I made sure I put one complete induction video so whoever watched it can benefit from that, this week. I apologize for the lateness and the mess that was today's tutorial AAANNNNDDD the fact that these videos were late haha, hopefully won't happen anymore. :)</p>

        <p class="disable_text_highlighting">Sorry for being late again, I finally got a new computer so hopefully things should get better. Anyways, EEYYYY, we have finally reached Runtime Analaysis. Trust me when I say that this is going to come in handy in literally (almost) every single project that you'll work on in the future. It's so important that I also did your readings before making the slides, so that I don't miss anything when I want to teach this stuff. Make sure you learn this very very well. (PS. No video for q4 since apperently you guys havent learned the material yet, so I'll post it next week)</p>

        <p class="disable_text_highlighting">Okay so I'm gonna try something new, I'm gonna lowkey upload this rn (friday 11:30 pm) and then post the videos later, so that even if they're late, you can still have the slides and get familiar with the material. Let's see if this method works out and hopefully everything's gonna be good. Aside from that, I have also included last weeks Question 4 in this weeks set of videos, so if you're reading this in December trying to study before the exam, ITS HERE FAMMMM!!! ITS NOT IN WEEK 3! And yeah that is all. :)</p>
