        <p> Hi guys! Sorry about me turning off link sharing from from Google Drive, but I felt like QR codes are cool and all but this method is more elegant and an easier way for you guys to grab the tutorial stuff. And the fact that some students couldn't get the QR code thing really bothered me. Hopefully this can actually be beneficial. :) </p>

        <p>Alright so as promised the Slides are up before the end of the day. A
        lot of students were wondering when we are going to give back the midterms
        and obviously we're just kidding on piazza lol. The truth is that we don't
        have a definit answer either, the plan is to do it as soon as possible.
        In the meantime, I want to wish you guys a good luck on all of your midterms and
        please remember, all nighters are never a good decision lol.</p>
