        <p> Hi guys! Sorry about me turning off link sharing from from Google Drive, but I felt like QR codes are cool and all but this method is more elegant and an easier way for you guys to grab the tutorial stuff. And the fact that some students couldn't get the QR code thing really bothered me. Hopefully this can actually be beneficial. :) </p>
