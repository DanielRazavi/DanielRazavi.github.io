        <p> Hi guys! Sorry about me turning off link sharing from from Google Drive, but I felt like QR codes are cool and all but this method is more elegant and an easier way for you guys to grab the tutorial stuff. And the fact that some students couldn't get the QR code thing really bothered me. Hopefully this can actually be beneficial. :) </p>

        <p>Alright so as promised the Slides are up before the end of the day. A
        lot of students were wondering when we are going to give back the midterms
        and obviously we're just kidding on piazza lol. The truth is that we don't
        have a definit answer either, the plan is to do it as soon as possible.
        In the meantime, I want to wish you guys a good luck on all of your midterms and
        please remember, all nighters are never a good decision lol.</p>

        <p>I like to call this week "review week" since after all the midterms and preperations you went through, it is now time to go over the new stuff  you might have missed for a class (not neccessarily this one). Maybe it wasn't covered by the midterm or maybe you decided to give yourself a break. Whatever the case, right now is the prefect time to prepare for the next wave, it is never too soon.</p>

        <p>And that was the second test of this course and after this is just problems sets and the exam. Students were having concerns with the midterm when I talked with them last night, and a lot of people were also displeased with their experiences regarding this course in the survey that we took last week. I am here to tell you that your comments will not be unheard and I will make sure that all TAs and professors hear about them. <p>
        <br>
        <p>Ps. sorry if the mathematical symbols are not done as well as my other slides, I didn't have much time to make the math on latex. Pss. hence why we also don't have recommended youtube videos, but since it is "take two" of program correctness, it shouldnt be an issue.</p>

        <p>Quick Update: I have apperently presented you guys with the wrong marking scheme in my slides, so for now, they are off the slides, and for Regular Expressions please take a look at notes.pdf, pages 68 to 72 :)<p>
