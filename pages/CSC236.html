        <p class="disable_text_highlighting"> Hi guys! Sorry about turning off link sharing from Google Drive, but I felt like QR codes are cool and all but this method is more elegant and an easier way for you guys to grab the tutorial stuff. And the fact that some students couldn't get the QR code thing working really bothered me. Hopefully this can actually be beneficial. :) </p>

        In the meantime, I want to wish you guys a good luck on all of your midterms and

I am here to tell you that your comments will not be unheard and I will make sure that all TAs and professors hear about them. </p>

        <p class="disable_text_highlighting">Ps. sorry if the mathematical symbols are not done as well as my other slides, I didn't have much time to make the math on latex. Pss. hence why we also don't have recommended youtube videos, but since it is "take two" of program correctness, it shouldnt be an issue.</p>
