Anyways, EEYYYY, we have finally reached Runtime Analaysis. Trust me when I say that this is going to come in handy in literally (almost) every single project that you'll work on in the future. It's so important that I also did your readings before making the slides, so that I don't miss anything when I want to teach this stuff. Make sure you learn this very very well. (PS. No video for q4 since apperently you guys havent learned the material yet, so I'll post it next week)</p>

I hope y'all had a lovely reading week and took advantage of the week by either getting ahead in the course, getting caught up or simply taking the time to refresh and get away from it all! I took the time for myself to finally FINAALLYYY record all the remaining tutorials! I just need to put em together and no more late videos!!! yaaayyy! This week's tutorial we're going to work out a structural induction question in class and I'm gonna try to answer some questions regarding the midterm.

I hope you guys are doing well becuase I remember being a second year student in first semester, having STA256, MAT232, MAT223, CSC207, and more and more and more crazy subject in one semester.

I hope everyone had a good time with this one, will look forward to the reddit posts and discord discussions afterwards to hear everyone's feedback. Till then here's what we're going to be working on Monday. It's another one of those lessons that in my opinin, will be what you remember it for and how important it is. Now it is different compared to the CSC207 version, so bare that in mind, but the idea is very similar.</p>

        <p class="disable_text_highlighting">Recommendation: For Regular Expressions please take a look at notes.pdf, pages 68 to 72, regex in this course is not similar to the one you're probably studying in CSC207 or anything presented online. :)</p>
