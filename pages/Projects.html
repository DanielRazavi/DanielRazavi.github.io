			<h1> Welcome. </h1>
			<p>Welcome to my programming portfolio. obviously not all my projects are here but the projects here are the ones that I am really proud of. Some are still under construction so please be wary of that if you download. My resume is also on this page, incase if you were wondering.</p>
			<br>
			<p> This page is constantly getting updated and redesigned for a better flow with the UI of the site. You can check out some of my other projects at Github itself.<p>

			<h1 class="hint">Calculator.</h1>
			<h1> Apple Calculator on Android.</h1>
			<p>This android app is a clone of the calculator app on iOS. I have used the Shunting-Yard algorithm to get the information from the user and I have used Postfix algorithm to grab that information and calculate it's the output. I have also designed the calculator in a modular fashion where adding new operations to the calculator can be done easily. Similar to the iOS calculator app, more operations are preseneted once application is set in landscape.</p>

			<h1 class="hint">Blank.</h1>
			<h1> "Blank." The Website.</h1>
			<p>This is my personal website and where you are currently reading this from! It is a place that I have created to showcase some of my projects in a more pleasent way, to show off my photos, maybe post some music and to (sometimes) provide resources for some of my students. Its my place on the web. Using pure HTML and CSS at first but as time went on, I added more and more technologies here and there.</p>

		<div class="project">
			<h1 class="hint">Pixel Royale.</h1>
			<h1> "Pixel Royale" The Game.</h1>
			<p>A 2D game heavily inspired by Fortnite, with a paintjob of the retro 80s! A little game created with Javascript, Node.JS, and rest API. You can play against AI agents that similar to you, can pick up weapons and can try to kill you. With a randomly generated map everytime you play the game. This Collaboration with Alex Luu, took us nearly a week to reach  the minimum gaming experience and was less about formatting and more about learning since it is the first attempt at the said technology.</p>
