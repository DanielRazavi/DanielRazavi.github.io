Some are still under construction so please be wary of that if you download. My resume is also on this page, incase if you were wondering.</p>

    <h1><img src="../files/icons-sys-imgs/calculator_icon.PNG" alt="Calculator Icon" align="left" class="icon disable_text_highlighting"> iOS calculator for Android. </h1>
		<p class="disable_text_highlighting">This android app is a clone of the calculator app on iOS. I have used the Shunting-Yard algorithm to get the information from the user and I have used Postfix algorithm to grab that information and calculate it's the output. I have also designed the calculator in a modular fashion where adding new operations to the calculator can be done easily. Similar to the iOS calculator app, more operations are preseneted once application is set in landscape.</p>

    <p class="disable_text_highlighting">***Currently the calculator still doesn't fully support all operations.***</p>

		<h1 style="font-size:4vw" class="hint disable_text_highlighting">Resume.</h1>
  	<h1 class="disable_text_highlighting"> My Resume as of Februrary 1, 2019 </h1>
		<p class="disable_text_highlighting"> Well here it is, my most recent resume! Now there are two of them, one is a plain old .pdf that you can easily grab. The other resume is also here and it is available for developers, but its more challenging to get, and once you do, you realize that it's in a .tex format. That resume will have more information on who I am since it has many comments here and there explaining more about almost all aspects of the resume, so it might be worth the challenge. Don't worry, if you're a developer, it should be a breeze.</p>
