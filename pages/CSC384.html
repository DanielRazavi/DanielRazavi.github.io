    	<h1 class="disable_text_highlighting">CSC384 Assignment 1 Announcement.</h1>

    	<p class="disable_text_highlighting">Hi guys, so a lot of people had questions regarding the marking that we did for A1. As you know, in the first 4 questions we asked the students to implement DFS, BFS, UCS and A*(with a constant heuristic) and we asked for each of those algorithms to return the actions necessary to get from point A to point B. The auto-grader that was given to you, checked your solution against what the solution should be and gave a mark based on that.</p>

      <p class="disable_text_highlighting">The auto-grader that we used did that AND MORE. Let there exist a test/map has only one solution, regardless of what algorithm you use, the output will always
      be the same, a student could put for example DFS in place of BFS and get that mark. So it was our task to create a marking system that will mark solutions based on more then just the list of actions. That's when it was decided to also check what states your agent has visited and seen (seen = states that have been a pushed to your stack/queue/priority-queue at one time or another) to see if it is correctly traversing the states to find its solutions.</p>

      <p class="disable_text_highlighting">The specific states that you have visited/seen and their specific orders are unique to the algorithm you have used, DFS, BFS, UCS and A* all have their own
      signature visited and seen state lists, so if your algorithms were defined and created correctly, they should also share the same exact visited and seen. That's what we checked for when marking: the actual solution of the test, a list of visited states for the test, and a list of seen states for the test. Each solution needs to satisfy those conditions in order to get the 1 mark for said test. And to give more chances to your code, we also gave the implementation more tests to perform in, as it was expected.</p>

      <p class="disable_text_highlighting">In order to achieve such information collection of your code, changing your code would have been wrong of us to do, so we changed the functionality of the autograder.py, grade_helpers.py and game_state_handler.py so that whenever you call any function in said files, we also get a copy of what you accessed.</p>

      <p class="disable_text_highlighting">Regarding questions 5 and 6, in order to mark those questions, there was no easy and pragmatic way to classify what a good/bad heuristic is so we decided to create a benchmark of what the minimum performing performance we expect is and if the student's performance is better or equal, then they are awarded the mark, and if not, they are not. We also made sure that your heuristics are marked based on a correct search_algorithm.py, so even if your A* is incorrect, your heuristics marks are not affected (hence why the autograder in the marking environment is split in half).</p>

      <p class="disable_text_highlighting">The marking environment is given to you and you can try it out yourself, to see your mark (since we are not providing you with the correct search_algorithm.py code, the autograder might give you marks that are not accurate). Feel free to share any feedback you have so that if there is a concern with the marking, our team can take the necessary steps to fix or explain the situation.</p>

    	<h1 class="disable_text_highlighting">CSC384 Assignment 2 Announcement.</h1>

    	<p class="disable_text_highlighting">Hi Again! Lets get down to it (hopefully in less writing then for A1 haha). When it came to marking A2 we did not add any tracking functions in other classes, simply added new tests. In the codes you will see something called trace_visited and trace_seen, which is the remains of a more in depth marking system that we decided against using.</p>

    	<p class="disable_text_highlighting">Similar to Assignment 1, we made sure that no one was penalized for the same thing twice, so the files were all marked with the counterfiles being perfect (you can see this in the provided code). Similar to Assignment 1, we will not be providing the perfect solutions, so the autograders will not be giving the same mark as your final mark. Feel free to share any feedback you have so that if there is a concern with the marking, our team can take the necessary steps to fix or explain the situation.</p>

    	<h1 class="disable_text_highlighting">CSC384 Assignment 3 Announcement.</h1>

    	<p class="disable_text_highlighting">Hey there! When it came to marking A3, we were very straight forward with the marking and we did not implement any new tactics in the other files for marking. We added the necessary new tests and ran your codes. Looking at the given code you will see IN_DEPTH_MARKING that is set to False which is the remains of a marking system that we decided against using.</p>

    	<p class="disable_text_highlighting">Hey there! When it came to marking A4, we did absolutely nothing for our marking!! Let me clarify, we didn't add any new tests and did not add any trackers in any other files. We believe that all the necessary tests were given to the students and the tests should be enough to check the authenticity of the students' code. Similar to all other assignments, we made sure that no one was penalized for the same thing twice, so the files were all marked with the counterfiles being perfect (you can see this in the provided code). We will not be providing the perfect solutions, so the autograders might not be giving the same mark as your final mark.
