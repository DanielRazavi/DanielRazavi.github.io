		<h1>Welcome to my first Website!</h1>
		<p>Hi there, My name is Daniel Razavi and this is the first website I have ever worked on! Crazy to think fourth year computer science student has never done any web development but unfortunatly, this is the case. I attend university of toronto and the past three years has been nothing but programming projects that I had to do, not any that I wanted to do, so this time around, im trying to change that. Hopefully this site can be a place where I can showcase my projects. (BTW this site is still under construction, so if a button doesn't take you anywhere, I'm sorry in advance :P)</p>
