            <h1>hi.</h1>
            <p>My name is Daniel Razavi and this is my little place on the web.  A little about me is that I've attended University of Toronto for Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics. I love taking photos, making some great playlists and putting together puzzles of any and all kinds. In a sea of projects that I've had to do, I'm trying to prioritize the projects I love/want to do. Hopefully this place can be a place where I can showcase my projects and honestly anything else I feel like putting. By the way this place is always under construction, so if a button doesn't work or any other weird thing, email me and let me know :D</p>
