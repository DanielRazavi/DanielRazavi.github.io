          Welcome back to week 2, obviously from the title you can see that we
          are working on Complete Induction and Structural Induction this week.
          In last weekâ€™s Youtube Recommendations, I made sure I put one complete
          induction video so whoever watched it can benefit from that, this
          week. I apologize for the lateness and the mess that was today's
          tutorial AAANNNNDDD the fact that these videos were late haha,
          hopefully won't happen anymore. :)

        <p>
          Sorry for being late again, I finally got a new computer so hopefully
          things should get better. Anyways, EEYYYY, we have finally reached
          Runtime Analaysis. Trust me when I say that this is going to come in
          handy in literally (almost) every single project that you'll work on
          in the future. It's so important that I also did your readings before
          making the slides, so that I don't miss anything when I want to teach
          this stuff. Make sure you learn this very very well. (PS. No video for
          q4 since apperently you guys havent learned the material yet, so I'll
          post it next week)

          Okay so I'm gonna try something new, I'm gonna lowkey upload this rn
          (friday 11:30 pm) and then post the videos later, so that even if
          they're late, you can still have the slides and get familiar with the
          material. Let's see if this method works out and hopefully
          everything's gonna be good. Aside from that, I have also included last
          weeks Question 4 in this weeks set of videos, so if you're reading
          this in December trying to study before the exam, ITS HERE FAMMMM!!!
          ITS NOT IN WEEK 3! And yeah that is all. :)

          Hey guys! I hope y'all had a lovely reading week and took advantage of
          the week by either getting ahead in the course, getting caught up or
          simply taking the time to refresh and get away from it all! I took the
          time for myself to finally FINAALLYYY record all the remaining
          tutorials! I just need to put em together and no more late videos!!!
          yaaayyy! This week's tutorial we're going to work out a structural
          induction question in class and I'm gonna try to answer some questions
          regarding the midterm. Aside from that I'm gonna take some time to
          talk about Problem Set 1 and what happened. Aside from those that is
          all for now, till next week's post.

        <p>
          Hi guys! Welcome to post test tutorial week! I hope you did well in
          the test and found it not so bad. In my opinion you should take a
          quick break from this class and then (if you haven't already) to
          really catch up if you are behind, since you're not gonna have any
          assignments or tests for some time. I hope you guys are doing well
          becuase I remember being a second year student in first semester,
          having STA256, MAT232, MAT223, CSC207, and more and more and more
          crazy subject in one semester. You got this! Don't give up! You can do
          it!

        <h1>Week 9 - Languages and Regular Expressions.</h1>
        <p>
          Hi guys! Another month and another term test. I hope everyone had a
          good time with this one, will look forward to the reddit posts and
          discord discussions afterwards to hear everyone's feedback. Till then
          here's what we're going to be working on Monday. It's another one of
          those lessons that in my opinin, will be what you remember it for and
          how important it is. Now it is different compared to the CSC207
          version, so bare that in mind, but the idea is very similar.

          Now, some of them might be helpful, and other might not be as much
          since other universities and institutions might do things differently.
          I'll try my best to keep adding to this. Feel free to also use the
          videos recommended in the previous weeks.

          Again, like I mentioned in class, please remember that the regular
          expression that is taught in class (CSC236) is different from the
          regular expression that is presented elsewhere. And also, all the
          links you see here are not a recommendation of your professors, simply
          the recommendation of a student who took this course years ago and
          found them useful.
